# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
An Obstacle Avoiding Robot is a type of autonomous mobile robot that avoids collision with unexpected obstacles. The design of obstacle avoidance robot requires the integration of many sensors according to their task. The obstacle detection is primary requirement of this autonomous robot. The robot gets the information from surrounding area through mounted sensors on the robot. Some sensing devices used for obstacle detection like bump sensor, infrared sensor, ultrasonic sensor etc. Ultrasonic sensor is most suitable for obstacle detection and it is of low cost and has high ranging capability. A simple project on Obstacle Avoiding Robot is designed here.
